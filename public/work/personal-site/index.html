      <h1>Why make it from scratch?</h1>

      <p>When I started working on this site, I did not consider myself a web developer. So, the obvious choice for a portfolio-oriented site seemed to be a nice Wordpress theme that would let me focus on content and visual details without having to worry about much else.</p>

      <p>Instead, I chose to take a leap and make it from scratch, because I wanted to have a better understanding of what it takes to make a website from the ground up, and because I knew there were enough free resources online to get me through it. So, I spent a weekend on Codecademy to refresh my knowledge of the basics and get a better understanding of how to use Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks.</p>

      <p>Before diving into the site, I decided to roughly sketch what the first version of the site might look like. I wanted a simple layout featuring a few of my most recent projects, but I also wanted to push myself in terms of going a little bit beyond the basics of HTML/CSS that I had just learned.</p>

      <!--figure>

        <figcaption>Rough sketch of the first version of my site, with work examples showing more information when hovered over.</figcaption>
      </figure-->

      <p>As soon as I began trying to bring that sketch to life, I realized that a guided example in an online course is worlds apart from actually building it. Thankfully, any question I had was already on StackExchange, so I was able to Google my way through every roadblock. After getting the bones of the site close enough to my sketch, I stepped back and reviewed my progress.</p>

      <p>While I was happy with my progress, I knew my initial sketch would need to be modified. That was alright, however, because rapid iteration is something I preach and practice at <a href="http://bcdfa.com" target="_blank">Barnard-Columbia Design for America</a>, so applying that to web development was not particularly daunting. I returned to pen and paper to clean up the layout of the site and let each work example breathe. I also wanted to make sure that whatever design I settled on would be more responsive and accessible than the first version, so I sketched out the mobile layout first and removed the hover states. <!--Finally, I decided to include ongoing projects along with completed work, so I worked on setting those examples apart. These changes occurred over several different versions of the site, so for brevity I will share the last sketches I made before this current iteration.</p>

      <p>Looking back on my decision to make my website instead of using something like Wordpress or Squarespace, it definitely feels like the right one. Not only can I make a decent landing page, I also have a much better understanding of the work it takes to bring a site to life from a designer's sketch, and in the future I should be able to quickly throw together a prototype to test a concept.</p>

      <p>Of course, making this on my own means that there are minor bugs and issues that need fixing. However, I know that going back and improving this website will only make me better and reinforce the lessons I've learned, which for me is the best way to retain a skill. I highly recommend the experience.</p>
